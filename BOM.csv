PID Line follower kit,1,75$,Jsumo,JS15331,JSUMO 15331 - JSUMO 2WD Chassis Kit,Includes everything except motors wheels motordriver sensors and microcontroller
Motors,2,29.9$,Jsumo, JS19198,JSUMO JS19198 - JSUMO ProFast Motors 5900 rpm 12v,This is a risk, 6000 mp12s have a really low torque so I am also getting the 2000 rpms just in case these dont have enough torque.
Motors,2,29.9$,Jsumo, JS19199,JSUMO JS15199- JSUMO ProFast Motors 2000 rpm 12v,These are the 2000 rpm motors, these have a low rpm so they are there just incase.
microcontroller,1,$53.59,Sparkfun,DEV-16997, teensy 4.0,This is the microcontroller I am using, it has a lot of pins and is fast enough to handle the sensors and motors.
Motordriver,1,$2,digilog,zk5ad, zk5ad,This is the motor driver I am using, it is cheap and one which I am very familiar with.
