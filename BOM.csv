PID Line follower kit,1,122$,Jsumo,JS15331,https://www.jsumo.com/arduino-pid-based-line-follower-kit,JSUMO 15331 - JSUMO 2WD Chassis Kit,Includes everything except motors wheels motordriver sensors and microcontroller. Also I inscluded the shipping price into this
Motors,2,29.9$,Jsumo, JS19198,https://www.jsumo.com/profast-12v-5900rpm-fast-gearmotor,JSUMO JS19198 - JSUMO ProFast Motors 5900 rpm 12v,This is a risk. 6000 n20 have a really low torque so getting the kit is reasonable just in case these dont have enough torque.
Wheels,1,16.7$,Jsumo, JS2042,,JSUMO JS2042 - JSUMO 2WD Wheels,These are the wheels I am using, they are 20x42mm and are sillicone high grip wheels.
microcontroller,1,$60.19,Sparkfun,DEV-20360,https://www.sparkfun.com/teensy-4-1-without-ethernet-headers.html,teensy 4.1,This is the microcontroller I am using. It has a lot of analog pins and is fast enough to handle the sensors and motors.
Motor Driver,1,$1.8,Digilog,Tb6612fng,https://digilog.pk/products/tb6612fng-motor-driver-module-for-arduino-in-pakistan?_pos=1&_sid=51d448715&_ss=r,Tb6612fng motor motordriver,Decent cheap motordriver. I am not very familiar with it but it seems to work well with the teensy 4.0 and the motors.
Buck Converter,1,$1.1,mekatroniks,LM2596S,https://mekatroniks.com/product/lm2596-hvs-high-voltage-buck-adjustable-step-down-in-pakistan/,LM2596S,A 5v buck works well since teensy 4.0 needs 5v to run and outputs the 3v i need for the sensors. 
Sensor array, 2,$51,Pololu,4253,https://www.pololu.com/product/4253,QTR MD 13A,These are known as the best sensors besides the qtrx which are like twice the price. Not too familiar with them and will have to be careful with them since they are quite expensive.
