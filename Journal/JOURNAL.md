I am right now just looking at all the prices and different things, this is difficult, to make a winning bot in less 350$, shipping is killing my budget, once I see the customs my soul might acu.(I live in pakistan) All things considered, ali express isnt actually cheaper than getting the products directly from their manufacturer. ![alt text](image.png)
I have been looking at options for like an hour now.Its between QTR 8A and the QTRX 13MD. The motors, i have found really good. I am thinking of getting the jsumo kit.

Ok I think I have a good idea of what I want in my bot-Besides motors Im going to need multiple iterations of jsumo profast motors for that
