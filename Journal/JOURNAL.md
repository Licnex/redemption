# Redemption - NERC 2026 Line Follower

**Total Hours:** 19.8 hours | **Budget:** ~$350

## 📅 July 1, 2025 | ⏱️ 5.0 hours
**(9:23pm)** I am right now just looking at all the prices and different things, this is difficult, to make a winning bot in less 350$, shipping is killing my budget, once I see the customs my soul might acu.(I live in pakistan) All things considered, ali express isnt actually cheaper than getting the products directly from their manufacturer. I have been looking at options for like an hour now.Its between QTR 8A and the QTRX 13MD. The motors, i have found really good. I am thinking of getting the jsumo kit. *(worked for 3 hours)*

**(11:53pm)** Ok I think I have a good idea of what I want in my bot-Besides motors Im going to need multiple iterations of jsumo profast motors for that. Going to work on the bom now. *(worked for 2 hours)*

## 📅 July 2, 2025 | ⏱️ 1.0 hour  
**(12:30am)** Just finished the BOM.csv and read me I think they will be nice for now. *(worked for 1 hour)*

## 📅 July 3, 2025 | ⏱️ 6.0 hours
**(2:58pm)** Alright leme cook up a schematic for this thing though it wont use a pcb I think I should still have one. *(worked for 4 hours)*

**(7:02pm)** I should work on the basic chassis now. *(worked for 2 hours)*

**(9:03pm)** chassis is alright, it isnt great (I will add motor mounts to do 3d once I understand the proper code).

## 📅 July 4, 2025 | ⏱️ 1.0 hour
**(1:01pm)** I forgor how qtr and pid works so Imma watch a video on that. *(worked for 1 hour)*

**(2:23pm)** Alright i am pretty burned out so Ill just relax for a day.

**(3:59pm)** Oh mb the journal is supposed to have the time spent written day wise as well. *(worked for 10 minutes)*

**(4:10pm)** I should work on the code now. I'll have to make multiple iterations and take this step by step but it should be easy. *(worked for 1 hour)*

**(5:31pm)** Alright I finished the pid code. Now the nerc track code and the test code is left, those will take some time. *(worked for 20 minutes)*

**(6:00pm)** alright I just checked, digilog has the tb661fng a motordriver much better than a zk5ad,leme update the bom and what not to have that. *(worked for 5 minutes)*

**(8:01pm)** Aftari and prayers are done, Im going to code in arduino IDE for a bit-Actually I just remembered I have to update the schematic for the tb6612fng. *(worked for 12 minutes)*

**(10:05pm)** Alright I finished the PID Test and motors test.ino and also reformated the code for tb6612fnd, zk5ad uses its direction pins as pwm pins, tb5512fng does not, had to learn how everything worked since im not familiar with tb6612fng. *(worked for 2 hours)*

**(10:22pm)** aight time to code for the nerc track. I'll have to code artificial any degree turns and a proper junction counter *(worked for 3 hours)*

## 🎯 July 7, 2025 - Next Steps
**(1:43am)** I have done 16 hours of work, I need to do 4 more hours to even begin qualifing for tier 3, so I think if I spend a bit more like 50$ more I can get a qtrx 14a which should be complex enough for me to take 4hours+ to refactor and understand it. Also due it being so advanced I think it should take me longer to do things with it, like solder it.Imma do that once I finish refactoring this journal. *(worked for 10 minutes)*
