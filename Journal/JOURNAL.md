## 2023-11-24: Added "Back to Top" Navigation Links

Today I improved the documentation by adding "Back to Top" navigation links to all major sections of the README.md file. This makes it easier for readers to navigate the document, especially as it grows in size.

Changes made:

- Added an anchor (`<a id="readme-top"></a>`) at the top of the document
- Added "Back to Top" links at the end of each major section:
  - Why?
  - Getting Started
  - Code Explanation & Setup
  - License
  - FAQ
  - Bill of Materials (BOM)

These navigation improvements make the document more user-friendly and professional in appearance.
