## 2023-11-24: Added "Back to Top" Navigation Links

Today I improved the documentation by adding "Back to Top" navigation links to all major sections of the README.md file. This makes it easier for readers to navigate the document, especially as it grows in size.

Changes made:

- Added an anchor (`<a id="readme-top"></a>`) at the top of the document
- Added "Back to Top" links at the end of each major section:
  - Why?
  - Getting Started
  - Code Explanation & Setup
  - License
  - FAQ
  - Bill of Materials (BOM)

These navigation improvements make the document more user-friendly and professional in appearance.

## 2025-07-17: Added Dance Code Explanation

Today I added documentation for the Dance.ino file to the README.md. The Dance program is a fun demo that showcases the robot's maneuverability with a choreographed dance routine.

Changes made:

- Added "Dance" to the Table of Contents
- Created a new "Dance" section with detailed explanation of the code
- Added code samples showing key functions used in the dance routine
- Listed the dance sequence steps

This addition completes the documentation of all code files in the project.
